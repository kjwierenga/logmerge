== About

Logmerge contains two utilities logmerge and ip2name.  logmerge merges Apache
access logs into one log ordered by date.  ip2name performs DNS lookups on
Apache access logs using multiple threads and Ruby's DNS resolver library to
speed through log files.

== Using logmerge

Simply pass in all the logs you want to merge on the command line.  logmerge
gives you the merged log on STDOUT.

  logmerge hal/access.log nestor/access.log herbie/access.log > merged.log

Note that logmerge expects the input log files to be ordered by date.

== Using ip2name

Simply pass in the log files you want to perform DNS lookups on the command
line or via STDIN.  ip2name gives you the looked-up log lines on STDOUT.

  ip2name < merged.log > resolved.log

  ip2name merged.log > resolved.log

In order to speed DNS lookups, ip2name creates a .name_cache file in the
current directory.  ip2name uses double the DNS record TTL value so
rapidly-changing names may not be correctly resolved.
